    #  :publicly_accessible - (Boolean) Specifies the accessibility options for the DB Instance.
    #                         A value of true specifies an Internet-facing instance with a publicly resolvable DNS name,
    #                         which resolves to a public IP address. A value of false specifies an internal instance with
    #                         a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.
    #                         Default: The default behavior varies depending on whether a VPC has been requested or not.
